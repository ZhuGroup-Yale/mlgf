In order of pipeline the scripts are:

1. mlgf.workflow.generate.py - calculates GW-level and HF-level features (generates input and/or labeled data for ML)
2. mlgf.lib.ml_helper.py - functions for getting sets of equivariant ML features
3. mlgf.data.data - object that holds DFT/MBGF data as numpy arrays, mlgf.data.dataset collects a list of these objects for processing
4. mlgf.model.gnn_orchestrator.py / mlgf.model.sklearn_model.py - controls GNN / KRR self-energy training and prediction
5. mlgf.workflow.get_ml_info.py - post processing functions for extracting properties from MBGF and self-energy
6. mlgf.workflow.model_errors - functions for additional ML error metrics
7. mlgf.workflow.get_bse.py - computes BSE excited states from outputs of get_ml_info.py

Summary of the checkpoint file central to this workflow (e.g. mol.chk), generated by mlgf.workflow.generate.py:

- Has keys 'scf' and 'mol' (identical to pyscf chkfile) 
- additional key 'mlf' (for "ML Features") where all DFT features are stored, in addition to MBGF labels (i.e. sigmaI) if available.
- important keys in 'mlf' are 'sigmaI' (self-energy on iomega in the MO basis), omega_fit (the points sigma is evaluated on)
